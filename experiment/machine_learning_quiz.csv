3,"When a machine learning model performs exceptionally well on training data but fails to generalize to unseen 'test' data, this phenomenon is known as:",Underfitting,Dimensionality reduction,Overfitting,Association rule learning,C
4,Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) utilize a 'minimax' game strategy. What are the primary roles of the two competing networks?,One reduces dimensionality while the other increases it.,One generates synthetic data while the other attempts to distinguish it from real data.,One performs classification while the other performs regression.,One manages the input features while the other optimizes the weights.,B
5,What is the fundamental difference between Supervised and Reinforcement Learning?,"Supervised learning requires a scalar reward signal, while Reinforcement Learning uses labeled pairs.",Supervised learning maps inputs to outputs based on ground-truth labels; Reinforcement Learning learns through trial-and-error interactions with an environment.,"Supervised learning is only for discrete data, whereas Reinforcement Learning is for continuous data.",There is no functional difference; they are synonyms for the same process.,B
